# Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?

> As of now, it takes too long for one professional to hear back from another professional on whether or not they are interested in connecting once a request has been sent to them. Sometimes, that response never comes because it is not as simple as a button click to respond to a request. For example, say, you messaged a professional on LinkedIn with your interest. That professional would respond to your message only if they also have an interest in you. However, if they are not interested in you, you might never hear back from them because they don't want to write back a message to you saying so.

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

> Droom is a revolutionalized LinkedIn app where you can swipe to the right to request to connect with a professional with the same interests as you, or you can swipe to the left if you want to pass on them or to gently decline their request to connect with you. Thus, drawing inspiration to match with each other from Tinder.

- What is the mission statement?

> Substantially reduce the time required to match with a professional who has the same interests as you. Once matched, it is upto the professionals to move forward with an interview, meet for coffee, etc.

# Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?

> 1. The landing page will have a CTA button that guides the user to the React app.
> 2. The landing page will be responsive to desktop and mobile devices.
> 3. The landing page will have at least a second page, such as 'our team' page.

- What features may you wish to put in a future release?

> 1. Have the landing page be responsive to a tablet.
> 2. Include a search functionality on the landing page that queries the backend for the professionals' profiles.

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?

> LinkedIn and AngelList are similar to Droom. They both provide a way to connect with an interesting person. However, neither of them have addressed how can a person easily and gently notify the other that they are not interested. The two apps also have many other products and there is, currently, no app that solely solves the matching problem.

# Frameworks

- What 3rd party frameworks are you considering using?

> None

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?

> No

- Are you required to pay to use the API?

> No

- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)

> No

# For Data Scientists

- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1.

- You can gather information about the data set you&#39;ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.

- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)

- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

# Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.

> This app can be used by any person or any company. For example, a person might want to be matched with a company for a job interview, a company might want to be matched with a person for a role, two people might want to get matched for expanding their network, two companies might want to get matched for a business proposal.

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?

> Not sure!

- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

> Not sure!

Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.

# Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the &quot;bread and butter&quot; of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you&#39;ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.

> I have already looked through many websites for inspirations on the layout and design of the landing page. I sketched a wireframe based on this, which has been already approved by the team. I have already built the layout based on my wireframe and filled it in with meaningful content.

> What's pending is the design, including responsiveness, which I estimate to take two days (Mon & Tues). On the third day (Wed), I'll work on the second page (likely 'Our Team' page). On the fourth day (Thurs), I'll do all final pending polishing.
